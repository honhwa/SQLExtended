# Manifests and the command table

Four files at the project root drive registration and packaging. Two are committed inputs, one is a
build output, one is a local dev-deploy artefact. They are easy to confuse — three of them are called
some variation of `extension.vsixmanifest`.

| File | Committed? | Needed? | Role |
|------|-----------|---------|------|
| `SsmsSchemaViewerPackage.vsct` | yes | **required** | The command table — menus, groups, buttons, keybindings |
| `source.extension.vsixmanifest` | yes | **required** | The VSIX manifest source; the only one you edit by hand |
| `merged.source.extension.vsixmanifest` | no (gitignored) | build output | Generated each build; safe to delete |
| `extension.vsixmanifest` | no (gitignored) | dev deploy only | Loose manifest for the xcopy install into SSMS |

## `SsmsSchemaViewerPackage.vsct`

The command table. It declares every menu, group and button the extension adds, plus the keybindings
(`Ctrl+Shift+D`, `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F`, …), and places them both in the top-level **SQLExtended** menu and
the editor context menu.

`SQLExtended.csproj` compiles it as a `VSCTCompile` item with `ResourceName=Menus.ctmenu`, which embeds
the compiled `.cto` as a managed resource in `SQLExtended.dll`. `SsmsSchemaViewerPackage.cs:34` then
declares `[ProvideMenuResource("Menus.ctmenu", 1)]`, which is what puts the pointer to that resource in
the generated `.pkgdef` so the shell can find it. **All three have to agree** — a command added to the
`.vsct` but not backed by a `MenuCommand` in code shows as greyed out; a `MenuCommand` with no `.vsct`
entry never appears at all.

## `source.extension.vsixmanifest`

The committed VSIX manifest, and the one to edit for display name, description, tags, install target,
or prerequisites. Two things in it must not be touched:

- **`Identity/@Id`** — how VSIXInstaller and Manage Extensions recognise an *upgrade* of this extension
  rather than a different one. Changing it orphans every installed copy.
- **`Identity/@Version`** — deliberately the placeholder `0.0.0`. The `StampVsixVersion` target in
  `SQLExtended.csproj` overwrites it from `version.txt` in the *generated* manifest, so this file stays
  out of every release diff. Don't hand-bump it. See the `releasing` skill for the version rules.

Its `Assets` use project tokens (`|%CurrentProject%;PkgdefProjectOutputGroup|`) which the SDK resolves
during the build — that is the difference between this file and the two below.

## `merged.source.extension.vsixmanifest`

Pure build output, written by the VSSDK's `MergeVsixManifestFile` target and consumed by
`DetokenizeVsixManifestFile`. It is the file `StampVsixVersion` actually edits. It lands in the project
root rather than `obj\` because the VSSDK targets are imported before the SDK's, so
`IntermediateOutputPath` is still empty when the default is computed. Gitignored; delete it any time
and the next build regenerates it. Nothing reads it after the `.vsix` is zipped.

## `extension.vsixmanifest`

Not part of the `.vsix` build at all. It is the **detokenized** manifest — real asset paths
(`SQLExtended.pkgdef`, `SQLExtended.dll`) instead of project tokens — that an xcopy-deployed extension
folder needs in order for SSMS to load it. `CopyToSsms` (in `SQLExtended.csproj`) copies it, if present,
into `…\Common7\IDE\Extensions\SQLExtended\` after every build, alongside the DLL and the pkgdef.

Because `DeployExtension=false`, that xcopy copy *is* the dev inner loop: build, then F5 into
`Ssms.exe`. Without this file the extension folder is inert. It is gitignored and created by hand — see
`SoluitionDocs/ManualInstall.md`.

**Its `Version` is hand-maintained.** `StampVsixVersion` only touches the merged manifest, so this file
does not track `version.txt` and will silently drift. It only affects what a locally xcopy-deployed
build reports, never a published release, but if you are chasing a version mismatch in a dev install,
this is where it comes from.

> Naming trap: the `.vsix` container also holds an entry named `extension.vsixmanifest` (that is the
> standard entry name inside the zip, and what `publish-release.ps1:173` reads the version from). That
> entry is the merged/stamped manifest — it has nothing to do with the loose file described here.
