/// <summary>
/// Reads replication state. Everything here runs on a background thread against connections derived from the
/// window's pinned connection.
///
/// Where the data lives decides the shape of this class. Unlike the Always On and Agent Jobs dashboards, which
/// each read one database, replication is spread across three:
///  * the <b>distribution database</b> holds publications, subscriptions, every agent and its history — the bulk
///    of the dashboard, and only readable when the connected instance is the distributor;
///  * <b>master</b> on the publisher holds the one thing the distributor cannot tell you, which is whether the
///    log can be truncated (log_reuse_wait_desc = REPLICATION) and how full it is;
///  * each <b>subscriber database</b> holds its own MSreplication_subscriptions, the only record of a pull
///    subscription's progress that does not depend on the distributor being reachable.
///
/// So a poll opens one connection per database it needs, and each section is collected in its own try/catch that
/// records a warning rather than throwing — a login with rights on master but not on the distribution database
/// should still get the publisher tab, not an error.
///
/// Deliberate choices worth keeping:
///  * The agents' latest history row is fetched with <c>OUTER APPLY … TOP (1) … ORDER BY time DESC</c> per agent
///    rather than a window function over the whole history table. MSdistribution_history is the largest table in
///    a busy distribution database; a ranked scan of all of it on a five-second timer is not acceptable, and
///    agent counts are small enough that a seek per agent is cheap.
///  * Latency is converted to seconds on the way in. The history tables report milliseconds, the tracer tokens
///    report datetimes, and sp_replcounters reports seconds — normalising once here means nothing downstream has
///    to remember which.
///  * The undelivered-command count and the error list load <b>on demand</b>. MSdistribution_status counts rows
///    in MSrepl_commands, which on a backlogged distributor is exactly when it is most expensive and most
///    wanted; putting it on the refresh timer would make the dashboard part of the problem.
